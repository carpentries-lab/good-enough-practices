# Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing

This repository contains a 3 hour carpentries format lesson covering [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing (Wilson et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510): "a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill".

The workshop is targeted at a broad audience of researchers who want to learn how to be more efficient and effective in their data analysis and computing, whatever their career stage.
Examples of our target audience are in [learner profiles](_extras/learner-profiles.md).
