## Introduction

### Discussion: research computing rights and wrongs

What can go wrong in research computing?

*

## Data management

### Discussion: Data management problems

*
*
*

### Exercise: Backing up your data

*Tag with G for good and B for bad:*

* Commercial cloud service
* In-house cloud service
* USB pen-drive
* External hard-drive
* My laptop
* My workstation’s hard-disk
* Network drive

### Discussion: which file formats do you store data in?

*
*
*

### Discussion with partner: analysis friendly data

*Vote with + for which table format you and your partner think is more friendly*

* column names: site, 1999, 2000
* column names: site, year, cases

### Discussion with group: sharing with the world

What type of data is each of these a good place for sharing?

* Group 1: Personal/lab web-site
* Group 2: Github
* Group 3: General repo (i.e.: Zenodo, Data Dryad, etc.)
* Group 4: Community specific repo (i.e.: ArrayExpress, SRA, EGA, PRIDE, etc.)

## Software

### Discussion: what can go wrong with research software?

*
*
*

### Exercise: which of these are good code comments?

*Discuss with your neighbour and vote with + beside ones you think are good.*

* “this function reads a file”
* file name
* file type
* output type
* date
* function author
* function version
* data columns or other properties
* expected file path / address (for example a specific directory or web address)
* all of the above

## Collaboration

### Discussion in groups

* Group 1: How does collaboration help in scientific computing?
* Group 2: What goes wrong with collaboration?
* Group 3: How can you prepare to collaborate?

### Discussion: what information belongs in a project README?

*
*
*

## Project organization

### Discussion in groups: what goes wrong?

*
*
*

### Exercise: file organization by directory

```
COSMIC_V94_download.csv
ensembl_variant_calls.pl
hg38.fa
multiplot.R
mutation_counts_by_primary_site.csv
mutation_counts.txt
p2_1_1.fastq.gz
p2_1_2.fastq.gz
p2_1.align.log
p2_1.bam
p2_1.bam.bai
p7_1_1.fastq.gz
p7_1_2.fastq.gz
p7_1.align.log
p7_1.bam
p7_1.bam.bai
parse_gdc_files_json.py
population_freq_by_codon_and_position.png
README.md
read_metrics.csv
read_processing.txt
read_quality_control_report.html
sample_counts_by_primary_site.csv
sample_ids.txt
```

### Exercise: file sorting

* What are the problems with having the date first?
* How do different date formats behave once sorted?
* Can you tell the importance of a leading 0 (zeros)?
* Is it equally easy to find all data from LD conditions as ON media?
* Can you spot the problem when using different cases (upper/lower)?
* Do you see benefits of keeping consistent lengths of the naming conventions?
* Do you see what happens when you mix conventions?

## Keeping track of changes

### Exercise: has this ever happened to you?

*Vote with + beside each item*

* I have fifteen versions of this file and I don’t know which is which
* I can’t remake this figure from last year
* I modified my code and something apparently unrelated does not work anymore
* I have several copies of the same directory because I’m worried about breaking something
* Somebody duplicated a record in a shared file with samples
* You remember seeing a data file but cannot find it anymore : is it deleted ? Moved away ?
* I tried multiple analysis and I don’t remember which one I chose to generate my output data
* I have to merge changes to a paper from mails with collaborators
* I accidently deleted a part of my work
* I came to an old project and forgot where I left it
* I have trouble to find the source of a mistake in an experiment
* My directory is polluted with a lot of unused/temporary/old folders because I’m afraid of losing something important
* I made a lot of changes to my paper but only want to bring back one of paragraph

### Discussion: what should be documented when you change something?
