## Expect varied audiences

We have run alpha versions of this workshop successfully with PhD students in the UK.
Later-year computational PhD students say "I wish I had know this when I started my PhD", and teaching these habits is the goal.

Learners will always have a mixture of backgrounds and skills, whatever their career stage.
Based on their education, past research experience, past jobs, and hobbies, there can be a lot of variation.
The goal of the material is that everyone has a chance to reflect on their practice and learn something valuable.


## Discussions are the opportunity for peer to peer learning

Discussions are the structured opportunity for learners to learn from each other, facilitated by the material and instructors/helpers.
In our experience, it is more effective if people learn from multiple peers than just from the instructor.
We found small discussions of 2-5 people effective, at a table or (online) in a breakout room.
Instructors/helpers can join these discussions if that's helpful.

It is useful to ask these small groups to summarize their discussions for the whole group.
Learners' horror stories, such as "I lost a month's worth of data because I hadn't backed it up", help to motivate.
Their success stories, such as "I started scripting my data analysis and it saved me lots of time", also help to motivate.


## This lesson prepares learners for version control, but does not teach it

This lesson helps to develop the motivation for using version control, and the organisation and attitudes that support productive use of version control software.
This lesson does not aim to teach version control, but instead aims to prepare users for a first course in git, such as the Carpentries git workshop.

If you have git users in the group, they may want to talk about how git solves all the problems. 
Be prepared to steer the conversations back to the material and suggest that learners take a git workshop in the future.
