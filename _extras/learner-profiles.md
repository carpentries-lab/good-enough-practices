right for you or your students. If you plan to contribute material to this
lesson, these will help you understand the target audience so that we can have
a collaboratively developed, but cohesive lesson.

## Miriam Microscopist

Miriam is a first-year PhD student in Biology, with an undergraduate degree in pharmacology and a masters in biochemistry.
She has moved to the UK from the Egypt for her PhD, and English is her second language.
Miriam will be generating a lot of data in her PhD from microscopy and other assays, but has never dealt with so much data before and hasn't thought through what is involved.
She has used mostly "Office"-style applications before, and has done barely any coding.
Miriam is taking this workshop as part of her PhD training and hasn't thought through what the workshop will do for her.
The course will help Miriam to get a picture of the data analysis and management challenges she will face during the PhD, and of the tools available to help her solve them. 
It will introduce the concept of scripted data analysis and why that might have benefits over GUI applications.

## Stuart Simulator

Stuart is starting his postdoc in epidemiology following a PhD in mathematics.
For his PhD, he did a mixture of theoretical work and simulations written in MATLAB.
Although he's written code in a few languages, he has picked it up as he goes along and has never had a programming-focused taught course.
Stuart struggles to organize his simulations and constantly loses track of which script produced which output, which has caused difficulties in collaborations.
Stuart is overconfident and thinks he knows a lot about computational work due to his degrees in mathematics; but he's started to realize that he is wasting a lot of time due to poor organization while some of his colleagues seem to be more efficient.
Stuart is taking the course because another postdoc told him he should use version control, as they were complaining about work at the departmental tea.
The course will introduce Stuart to good habits in project organization, file naming, and scripting, that can immediately help his work.
It will introduce the concepts of version control and could motivate Stuart to learn git.
