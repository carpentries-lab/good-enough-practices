## Miriam Microscopist

Miriam is a first-year PhD student in Biology, with an undergraduate degree in pharmacology and a masters in biochemistry.
She has moved to the UK from the Egypt for her PhD, and English is her second language.
Miriam will be generating a lot of data in her PhD from microscopy and other assays, but has never dealt with so much data before and hasn't thought through what is involved.
She has used mostly "Office"-style applications before, and has done barely any coding.
Miriam is taking this workshop as part of her PhD training and hasn't thought through what the workshop will do for her.
The course will help Miriam to get a picture of the data analysis and management challenges she will face during the PhD, and of the tools available to help her solve them. 
It will introduce the concept of scripted data analysis and why that might have benefits over GUI applications.
