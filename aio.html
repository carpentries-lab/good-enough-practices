<p>Computers are now essential in all branches of science. We use
computers to collect, analyze, and store data, to collaborate, and to
write manuscripts. Yet most researchers are never taught the equivalent
of basic lab skills for research computing.</p>
<p>This lesson covers a set of good computing practices that
<strong>every</strong> researcher can adopt, regardless of computational
skill. Informally, it teaches how to not lose your stuff, and generally
how to be more efficient.</p>
<p>Many of our recommendations are for the benefit of the collaborator
every researcher cares about most: their future self (as the joke goes,
yourself from 3 months ago doesn’t answer email…).</p>
<p>Practically, future you will either:</p>
<ul>
<li>curse current you (bad), or</li>
<li>thank current you (better).</li>
</ul>
<p>Adopting good practices is kind to your future self.</p>
<p>So, which habits and practices can save you time in the future and
improve your work?</p>

<p>Data within a project may need to exist in various forms, ranging
from what first arrives to what is actually used for the primary
analyses. Data management is the process of storing, documenting,
organizing, and sharing the data created and collected during a project.
Our recommendations have two main themes. One is to work towards
ready-to-analyze data incrementally, documenting both the intermediate
data and the process. We also describe the key features of “tidy data”,
which can be a powerful accelerator for analysis [<a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10" class="external-link">wickham2014</a>,

<ul>
<li>Commercial cloud service: it depends. Where are the servers located?
How secure is it? How reliable is it? Do you have to pay for the service
and what happens to your data if you can no longer afford it?</li>
<li>In-house cloud service: this is a good way to back up your data
(usually). You have local support. It is probably compliant with funders
and data security guidelines for most data sets. If you work with
particularly sensitive data (for example data of patients), we suggest
still discussing with IT and/or data security officers.</li>
<li>USB pen drive: definitely not! Pen-drives are prone to dying (and
your data with it). It also raises data security issues and they can be
easily lost.</li>
<li>External hard-drive: see above.</li>
<li>My laptop: it is good as a temporal storage solution for your active
data. However, you should back it up appropriately.</li>
<li>My workstation’s hard-disk: it is good as a temporal storage
solution for your active data. However, you should back it up
appropriately.</li>
<li>Network drive: this is a good way to back up your data (usually).
You have local support. It is probably compliant with funders and data
security guidelines.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Backing up your data is essential, otherwise it is a question of when
(not if) you lose it.</p>
<p>Where possible, save data as originally generated (i.e. by an
instrument or from a survey). It is tempting to overwrite raw data files
with cleaned-up versions, but faithful retention is essential for
re-running analyses from start to finish; for recovery from analytical
mishaps; and for experimenting without fear. Consider changing file
permissions to read-only or using spreadsheet protection features, so it
is harder to damage raw data by accident or to hand edit it in a moment
of weakness.</p>
<p>Some data will be impractical to manage in this way. For example, you
should avoid making local copies of large, stable databases. In that
case, record the exact procedure used to obtain the raw data, as well as
any other pertinent information, such as an official version number or
the date of download.</p>
<p>If external hard drives are used, store them off-site of the original
location. Universities often have their own data storage solutions, so
it is worthwhile to consult with your local Information Technology (IT)
group or library. Alternatively cloud computing resources, like Amazon
Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Google Cloud Storage or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/" class="external-link">Azure</a> are
reasonably priced and reliable. For large data sets, where storage and
transfer can be expensive and time-consuming, you may need to use
incremental backup or specialized storage systems, and people in your
local IT group or library can often provide advice and assistance on
options at your university or organization as well.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Identify whether your project will work with sensitive data - by
which we might mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research data including personal data or identifiers (this might
include names and addresses, or potentially identifyable genetic data or
health information, or confidential information)</li>
<li>Commercially sensitive data or information (this might include
intellectual property, or data generated or used within a restrictive
commercial research funding agreement)</li>
<li>Data which may cause harm or adverse affects if released or made
public (for example data relating to rare or endangered species which
could cause poaching or fuel illegal trading)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to understand the restrictions which may apply when
working with sensitive data, and also ensure that your project complies
with any applicable laws relating to storage, use and sharing of
sensitive data (for example, laws like the General Data Protection
Regulation, known as the GDPR). These laws vary between countries and
may affect whether you can share information between collaborators in
different countries.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>Filenames</em>: Store especially useful metadata as part of the
filename itself, while keeping the filename regular enough for easy
pattern matching. For example, a filename like
<code>2016-05-alaska-b.csv</code> makes it easy for both people and
programs to select by year or by location. Common file naming
conventions are discussed in the <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-storage.html" class="external-link">Turing
Way</a> and in the <a href="05-project_organization.html">Project
Organization</a> episode of this lesson.</p>
<p><em>Variable names</em>: Replace inscrutable variable names and
artificial data codes with self-explaining alternatives, e.g., rename
variables called <code>name1</code> and <code>name2</code> to
<code>first_name</code> and <code>family_name</code>, recode the
treatment variable from <code>1</code> vs. <code>2</code> to
<code>untreated</code> vs. <code>treated</code>, and replace artificial
codes for missing data, such as “-99”, with <code>NA</code>, a code used
in most programming languages to indicate that data is “Not Available”
[<a href="https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/IEE/article/view/4608" class="external-link">white2013</a>].</p>
<p><em>File formats</em>: Convert data from closed, proprietary formats
to open, non-proprietary formats that ensure machine readability across
time and computing setups [<a href="https://www.library.illinois.edu/rds/file-formats/" class="external-link">UIllinois</a>].
Good options include CSV for tabular data, JSON, YAML, or XML for
non-tabular data such as graphs, and HDF5 for certain kinds of
structured data.</p>
<p>Create the dataset you <em>wish</em> you had received. The goal here
is to improve machine and human readability, but <em>not</em> to do
vigorous data filtering or add external information. Machine readability
allows automatic processing using computer programs, which is important
when others want to reuse your data. Specific examples of
non-destructive transformations that we recommend at the beginning of
analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create analysis-friendly data</li>
<li>Record all the steps used to process data</li>
<li>Record different data types in individual tables as appropriate
(e.g. sample metadata may be kept separately from sequencing experiment
metadata)</li>
<li>Use unique identifiers for every record in a table, allowing
linkages between tables (e.g. sample identifiers are recorded in the
sequencing experiment metadata)</li>

<p>Analysis can be much easier if you are working with so-called “tidy”
data [<a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10" class="external-link">wickham2014</a>].
Two key principles are:</p>
<p><em>Make each column a variable</em>: Don’t cram two variables into
one, e.g., “male_treated” should be split into separate variables for
sex and treatment status. Store units in their own variable or in
metadata, e.g., “3.4” instead of “3.4kg”.</p>
<p><em>Make each row an observation</em>: Data often comes in a wide
format, because that facilitated data entry or human inspection. Imagine
one row per field site and then columns for measurements made at each of
several time points. Be prepared to gather such columns into a variable

<p>Data manipulation is as integral to your analysis as statistical
modeling and inference. If you do not document this step thoroughly, it
is impossible for you, or anyone else, to repeat the analysis.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to write scripts for <em>every</em> stage
of data processing. This might feel frustratingly slow, but you will get
faster with practice. The immediate payoff will be the ease with which
you can re-do data preparation when new data arrives. You can also
re-use data preparation steps in the future for related projects. For
very large data sets, data preparation may also include writing and
saving scripts to obtain the data or subsets of the data from remote
storage.</p>
<p>Some data cleaning tools, such as OpenRefine, provide a graphical
user interface, but also automatically keep track of each step in the
process. When tools like these or scripting is not feasible, it’s
important to clearly document every manual action (what menu was used,
what column was copied and pasted, what link was clicked, etc.). Often
you can at least capture <em>what</em> action was taken, if not the
complete <em>why</em>. For example, choosing a region of interest in an
image is inherently interactive, but you can save the region chosen as a
set of boundary coordinates.</p>

<p>Raw data, even if tidy, is not necessarily complete. For example, the
primary data table might hold the heart rate for individual subjects at
rest and after a physical challenge, identified via a subject ID.
Demographic variables, such as subject age and sex, are stored in a
second table and will need to be brought in via merging or lookup. This
will go more smoothly if subject ID is represented in a common format in
both tables, e.g., always as “14025” versus “14,025” in one table and
“014025” in another. It is generally wise to give each record or unit a
unique, persistent key and to use the same names and codes when
variables in two datasets refer to the same thing.</p>

two types of metadata: metadata about the dataset as a whole and
metadata about the content within the dataset. If the audience is
humans, write the metadata (the README file) for humans. If the audience

<p>Taken in order, the recommendations above will make it easier to keep
track of your data and to work with it. Saving the raw data along with
clear metadata, backed up, is your insurance policy. Creating
analysis-friendly data, and recording all the steps used to process
data, means that you and others can reproduce your analysis. Sharing
your data via DOI-issuing repository allows others can access and cite
it, which they will find easier if your data are analysis-friendly,
clearly named, and well-documented.</p>
<p>These recommendations include explicitly creating and retaining of
intermediate data files at intermediate steps of the analysis, with
increasing levels of cleanliness and task-specificity. Saving
intermediate files makes it easy to re-run <em>parts</em> of a data
analysis pipeline, which in turn makes it less onerous to revisit and
improve specific data processing tasks. Breaking a lengthy analysis
workflow into modular parts makes it easier to understand, share,
describe, and modify.</p>
<p>Modifying and sharing your data analysis is only possible if you
still have the raw data: <strong>back up your data!!!</strong></p>

<p>If you or your group are creating ten thousands lines of code for use
by hundreds of people you have never met, you are doing software
engineering. If you’re writing a few dozen lines now and again, and are
probably going to be its only user, you may not be doing engineering,
but you can still make things easier on yourself by adopting a few key
engineering practices. What’s more, adopting these practices will make
it easier for other people and your future self to understand and
(re)use your code.</p>
<p>The core realization in these practices is that <em>readable</em>,
<em>reusable</em>, and <em>testable</em> are all side effects of writing
<em>modular</em> code, i.e., of building programs out of short,
single-purpose functions with clearly-defined inputs and outputs [<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=The+Pragmatic+Programmer&amp;author=A+Hunt&amp;author=D+Thomas&amp;publication_year=1999" class="external-link">hunt1999</a>].

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A function is a reusable section of software that can be treated as a
black box by the rest of the program. This is like the way we combine
actions in everyday life. Suppose that it is teatime. You could get a
teabag, put the teabag in a mug, boil the kettle, pour the boiling water
into the mug, wait 3 minutes for the tea to brew, remove the teabag, and
add milk if desired. It is much easier to think of this as a single
function, “make a cup of tea”.</p>
<p>Software programming languages also allow you to combine many steps
into a single function. The syntax for creating functions depends on
programming language, but generally you:</p>
<ul>
<li>name the function</li>
<li>list its input parameters</li>
<li>describe what information it produces</li>
<li>write some lines of code that produce the desired output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good functions should have only one main task: for example, “make a
cup of tea” does not also specify how to make a sandwich. Functions can
also be built up from other functions: for example, “boil the kettle”
involves checking if there is water in the kettle, filling the kettle if
not, and then turning the kettle on. Having one main task means that
functions should take no more than five or six input parameters and
should not reference outside information. Functions should be no more
than one page (about 60 lines) long: you should be able to see the
entire function in a standard (~10pt) font on a laptop screen. If your
function grows larger than this, it is usually best to break that up
into simpler functions.</p>
<p>The key motivation here is to fit the program into the most limited
memory of all: ours. Human short-term memory is famously incapable of
holding more than about seven items at once [<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1957-02914-001" class="external-link">miller1956</a>]. If
we are to understand what our software is doing, we must break it into
chunks that obey this limit, then create programs by combining these
chunks. Putting code into functions also makes it easier to test and
troubleshoot when things go wrong.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode" class="external-link">Pseudocode</a> is
a plain language description of code or analysis steps. Writing
pseudocode can be useful to think through the logic of your analysis,
and how to decompose it into functions.</p>
<p>The “make a cup of tea” example above might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>    make_cup_of_tea = function(sugar, milk)

        if kettle is not full
            fill kettle

        boil kettle
        put teabag in cup
        add water from kettle to cup
        wait 2 minutes

        if sugar is true
            add sugar to cup
        if milk is true
            add milk to cup

        stir with spoon

        return cup</code></pre>

<p>Write and re-use functions instead of copying and pasting code, and
use data structures like lists instead of creating many closely-related
variables, e.g. create <code>score = (1, 2, 3)</code> rather than
<code>score1</code>, <code>score2</code>, and <code>score3</code>.</p>
<p>Also look for well-maintained libraries that already do what you’re
trying to do. All programming languages have libraries that you can
import and use in your code. This is code that people have already
written and made available for distribution that have a particular
function. For instance, there are libraries for statistics, modeling,
mapping and many more. Many languages catalog the libraries in a
centralized source, for instance R has CRAN, Python has PyPI, and so on.
So <strong><em>always search for well-maintained software libraries that
do what you need</em></strong> before writing new code yourself, but
<strong><em>test libraries before relying on them</em></strong>.</p>

grad students or postdocs in the lab, or they might be <em>you</em>
returning to a project that has been idle for some time. As summarized
in [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950584914002390?via%3Dihub" class="external-link">steinmacher2015</a>],
you want to make it easy for people to set up a local workspace so that
they <em>can</em> contribute, help them find tasks so that they know
<em>what</em> to contribute, and make the contribution process clear so
that they know <em>how</em> to contribute. You also want to make it easy
for people to give you credit for your work.</p>

place. An overview document can collect the most important information
about your project, and act as a signpost. The overview is usually the
first thing people read about your project, so it is often called a
“README”. The README has two jobs: describing the contents of the
project, and explaining how to interact with the project.</p>
<p>Create a short file in the project’s home directory that explains the
purpose of the project. This file (generally called <code>README</code>,
<code>README.txt</code>, or something similar) should contain :</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Because the README is usually the first thing users and collaborators
on your project will look at, make it explicit how you want people to
engage with the project. If you are looking for more contributors, make
it explicit that you welcome contributors and point them to the license
(more below) and ways they can help.</p>
<p>A separate <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> file can also describe what
people need to do in order to get the project going and use or
contribute to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependencies that need to be installed</li>
<li>Tests that can be run to ensure that software has been installed

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What Not To Do</strong></p>
<p>We recommend <em>against</em> the “no commercial use” variations of
the Creative Commons licenses because they may impede some forms of
re-use. For example, if a researcher in a developing country is being
paid by her government to compile a public health report, she will be
unable to include your data if the license says “non-commercial”. We
recommend permissive software licenses rather than the GNU General
Public License (GPL) because it is easier to integrate
permissively-licensed software into other projects, see chapter three in

<p>Similar to deciding when a chunk of code should be made a function,
the ultimate goal of dividing research into distinct projects is to help
you and others best understand your work. Some researchers create a
separate project for each manuscript they are working on, while others
group all research on a common theme, data set, or algorithm into a
single project.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, divide work into projects or modules based on the
overlap in data and code files. If two research efforts share no data or
code, they will probably be easiest to manage independently. If they
share more than half of their data and code, they are probably best
managed together, while if you are building tools that are used in
several projects, the common code should probably be in a project of its
own.</p>
<p>Projects do often require their own organizational model. The below
recommendations on how you can structure data, code, analysis outputs
and other files, are drawn primarily from [<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424" class="external-link">noble2009</a>,
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf" class="external-link">gentzkow2014</a>].
Other structures to consider are:</p>
<ul>

Turing Way</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/HeidiSeibold/research-project-template" class="external-link">An
individual researcher’s template</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The important concepts are that is useful to organize the project in
modules by the types of files and that consistent planning and good
names help you effectively find and use things later. Your lab or
organization may have a template to use.</p>

<p>This includes files for manuscripts, documentation for source code,
and/or an electronic lab notebook recording your experiments.
Subdirectories may be created for these different classes of files in
large projects.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>When we refer to “generated files”, this includes intermediate
results, such as cleaned data sets or simulated data, as well as final
results such as figures and tables.</p>
<p>The <code>results</code> directory will <em>usually</em> require
additional subdirectories for all but the simplest projects.
Intermediate files such as cleaned data, statistical tables, and final
publication-ready figures or tables should be separated clearly by file
naming conventions or placed into different subdirectories; those
belonging to different papers or other publications should be grouped
together. Similarly, the <code>data</code> directory might require
subdirectories to organize raw data based on time, method of collection,
or other metadata most relevant to your analysis.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="put-project-source-code-in-the-src-directory">Put project source code in the <code>src</code> directory<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#put-project-source-code-in-the-src-directory"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p><code>src</code> contains all of the code written for the project.
This includes programs written in interpreted languages such as R or
Python; those written compiled languages like Fortran, C++, or Java; as
well as shell scripts, snippets of SQL used to pull information from
databases; and other code needed to regenerate the results.</p>
<p>This directory may contain two conceptually distinct types of files
that should be distinguished either by clear file names or by additional
subdirectories. The first type are files or groups of files that perform
the core analysis of the research, such as data cleaning or statistical
analyses. These files can be thought of as the “scientific guts” of the
project.</p>
<p>The second type of file in <code>src</code> is controller or driver
scripts that contains all the analysis steps for the entire project from
start to finish, with particular parameters and data input/output
commands. A controller script for a simple project, for example, may
read a raw data table, import and apply several cleanup and analysis
functions from the other files in this directory, and create and save a
numeric result. For a small project with one main output, a single
controller script should be placed in the main <code>src</code>
directory and distinguished clearly by a name such as “runall”. The
short example below is typical of scripts of this kind; note how it uses
one variable, <code>TEMP_DIR</code>, to avoid repeating the name of a
particular directory four times.</p>
<pre><code>    TEMP_DIR = ./temp_zip_files

    echo "Packaging zip files required by analysis tool..."
    mkdir $(TEMP_DIR)
    ./src/make-zip-files.py $(TEMP_DIR) *.dat

    echo "Analyzing..."
    ./bin/sqr_mean_analyze -i $(TEMP_DIR) -b "temp"

    echo "Cleaning up..."
    rm -rf $(TEMP_DIR)</code></pre>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p><code>bin</code> contains executable programs compiled from code in
the <code>src</code> directory. Projects that do not have any will not
require <code>bin</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scripts vs. Programs</strong></p>
<p>We use the term “script” to mean “something that is executed directly
as-is”, and “program” to mean “something that is explicitly compiled
before being used”. The distinction is more one of degree than
kind—libraries written in Python are actually compiled to bytecode as
they are loaded, for example—so one other way to think of it is “things
that are edited directly” and “things that are not”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>External Scripts</strong></p>
<p>If <code>src</code> is for human-readable source code, and
<code>bin</code> is for compiled binaries, where should projects put
scripts that are executed directly—particularly ones that are brought in
from outside the project? On the one hand, these are written in the same
languages as the project-specific scripts in <code>src</code>; on the
other, they are executable, like the programs in <code>bin</code>. The
answer is that it doesn’t matter, as long as each team’s projects follow
the same rule. As with many of our other recommendations, consistency
and predictability are more important than hair-splitting.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>For example, use names such as <code>bird_count_table.csv</code>,
<code>manuscript.md</code>, or <code>sightings_analysis.py</code>. Do
<em>not</em> use sequential numbers (e.g., <code>result1.csv</code>,
<code>result2.csv</code>) or a location in a final manuscript (e.g.,
<code>fig_3_a.png</code>), since those numbers will almost certainly
change as the project evolves.</p>

<p>The diagram below provides a concrete example of how a simple project
might be organized following these recommendations:</p>
<pre><code>    .
    |-- CITATION
    |-- README
    |-- LICENSE
    |-- requirements.txt
    |-- data
    |   -- birds_count_table.csv
    |-- doc
    |   -- notebook.md
    |   -- manuscript.md
    |   -- changelog.txt
    |-- results
    |   -- summarized_results.csv
    |-- src
    |   -- sightings_analysis.py
    |   -- runall.py</code></pre>
<p>The root directory contains a <code>README</code> file that provides
an overview of the project as a whole, a <code>CITATION</code> file that
explains how to reference it, and a <code>LICENSE</code> file that
states the licensing. The <code>requirements.txt</code> file lists the
software that is required to run the data analysis. The
<code>data</code> directory contains a single CSV file with tabular data
on bird counts (machine-readable metadata could also be included here).
The <code>src</code> directory contains
<code>sightings_analysis.py</code>, a Python file containing functions
to summarize the tabular data, and a controller script
<code>runall.py</code> that loads the data table, applies functions
imported from <code>sightings_analysis.py</code>, and saves a table of
summarized results in the <code>results</code> directory.</p>
<p>This project doesn’t have a <code>bin</code> directory, since it does
not rely on any compiled software. The <code>doc</code> directory
contains two text files written in Markdown, one containing a running
lab notebook describing various ideas for the project and how these were
implemented and the other containing a running draft of a manuscript
describing the project findings.</p>

<p>Keeping track of changes that you or your collaborators make to data
and software is a critical part of research. Being able to reference or
retrieve a specific version of the entire project aids in
reproducibility for you leading up to publication, when responding to
reviewer comments, and when providing supporting information for
reviewers, editors, and readers.</p>
<p>We believe that the best tools for tracking changes are the version
control systems that are used in software development, such as Git,
Mercurial, and Subversion. They keep track of what was changed in a file
when and by whom, and synchronize changes to a central server so that
many users can manage changes to the same set of files.</p>
<p>While these version control tools make tracking changes easier, they
can have a steep learning curve. So, we provide two sets of
recommendations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a systematic manual approach for managing changes and</li>
<li>version control in its full glory,</li>
</ol>
<p>and you can use the first while working towards the second, or just

<li><p>Updated matplot library to version 3.4.3 and regenerated

<li><p>Reverted to the previous version of the abstract text as the

<li><p>Cleaned the strain inventory: Recent freezer cleaning and

physical samples were removed from the table, the duplicated ids are

<p>Our first suggested approach, in which everything is done by hand,
has two additional parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong><em>Add a file called <code>CHANGELOG.txt</code> to the
project’s <code>docs</code> subfolder</em></strong>, and make dated
notes about changes to the project in this file in reverse chronological
order (i.e., most recent first). This file is the equivalent of a lab
notebook, and should contain entries like those shown below.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>## 2016-04-08

* Switched to cubic interpolation as default.
* Moved question about family's TB history to end of questionnaire.

## 2016-04-06

* Added option for cubic interpolation.
* Removed question about staph exposure (can be inferred from blood test results).</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong><em>Copy the entire project whenever a significant change
has been made</em></strong> (i.e., one that materially affects the
results), and store that copy in a sub-folder whose name reflects the
date in the area that’s being synchronized. This approach results in
projects being organized as shown below:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>.
|-- project_name
|   -- current
|       -- ...project content as described earlier...
|   -- 2016-03-01

<p>Here, the <code>project_name</code> folder is mapped to external
storage (such as Dropbox), <code>current</code> is where development is
done, and other folders within <code>project_name</code> are old
versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Data is Cheap, Time is Expensive</strong></p>
<p>Copying everything like this may seem wasteful, since many files
won’t have changed, but consider: a terabyte hard drive costs about
\$50, which means that 50 GByte costs less than \$5. Provided large data
files are kept out of the backed-up area (discussed below), this
approach costs less than the time it would take to select files by hand
for copying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This manual procedure satisfies the requirements outlined above
without needing any new tools. If multiple researchers are working on
the same project, though, they will need to coordinate so that only a
single person is working on specific files at any time. In particular,
they may wish to create one change log file per contributor, and to
merge those files whenever a backup copy is made.</p>

<p>What the manual process described above requires most is
self-discipline. The version control tools that underpin our second

<p>Box 2 briefly explains how version control systems work. It’s hard to
know what version control tool is most widely used in research today,
but the one that’s most talked about is undoubtedly Git. This is largely
because of GitHub, a popular hosting site that combines the technical
infrastructure for collaboration via Git with a modern web interface.
GitHub is free for public and open source projects and for users in
academia and nonprofits. GitLab is a well-regarded alternative that some
prefer, because the GitLab platform itself is free and open source.
Bitbucket provides free hosting for both Git and Mercurial repositories,
but does not have nearly as many scientific users.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Box 2: How Version Control Systems Work</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>A version control system stores snapshots of a project’s files in a
repository. Users modify their working copy of the project, and then
save changes to the repository when they wish to make a permanent record
and/or share their work with colleagues. The version control system
automatically records when the change was made and by whom along with
the changes themselves.</p>
<p>Crucially, if several people have edited files simultaneously, the
version control system will detect the collision and require them to
resolve any conflicts before recording the changes. Modern version
control systems also allow repositories to be synchronized with each
other, so that no one repository becomes a single point of failure.
Tool-based version control has several benefits over manual version
control:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Instead of requiring users to make backup copies of the whole
project, version control safely stores just enough information to allow
old versions of files to be re-created on demand.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of relying on users to choose sensible names for backup
copies, the version control system timestamps all saved changes
automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of requiring users to be disciplined about completing the
changelog, version control systems prompt them every time a change is
saved. They also keep a 100% accurate record of what was
<em>actually</em> changed, as opposed to what the user <em>thought</em>
they changed, which can be invaluable when problems crop up
later.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of simply copying files to remote storage, version
control checks to see whether doing that would overwrite anyone else’s
work. If so, they facilitate identifying conflict and merging
changes.</p></li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The benefits of version control systems don’t apply equally to all
file types. In particular, version control can be more or less rewarding
depending on file size and format. First, file comparison in version
control systems is optimized for plain text files, such as source code.
The ability to see so-called “diffs” is one of the great joys of version
control systems. Unfortunately, Microsoft Office files (like the
<code>.docx</code> files used by Word) or other binary files, e.g.,
PDFs, can be stored in a version control system, but it is not always
possible to pinpoint specific changes from one version to the next.
Tabular data (such as CSV files) can be put in version control, but
changing the order of the rows or columns will create a big change for
the version control system, even if the data itself has not changed.</p>
<p>Second, raw data should not change, and therefore should not require
version tracking. Keeping intermediate data files and other results
under version control is also not necessary if you can re-generate them
from raw data and software. However, if data and results are small, we
still recommend versioning them for ease of access by collaborators and
for comparison across versions.</p>
<p>Third, today’s version control systems are not designed to handle
megabyte-sized files, never mind gigabytes, so large data or results
files should not be included. (As a benchmark for “large”, the limit for
an individual file on GitHub is 100MB.) Some emerging hybrid systems
such as <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/" class="external-link">Git LFS</a> put textual
notes under version control, while storing the large data itself in a
remote server, but these are not yet mature enough for us to
recommend.</p>

credentials, such as passwords and private keys, in a version control

<p>An old joke says that doing the research is the first 90% of any
project; writing up is the other 90%. While writing is rarely addressed
in discussions of scientific computing, computing has changed scientific
writing just as much as it has changed research.</p>
<p>Writing manuscripts is often collaborative, and so a team with
diverse backgrounds, skills, and expectations must work together. In our
experience, setting explicit expectations for writing is essential, just
like other collaborations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The First Rule Is…</strong></p>
<p>The workflow you choose is less important than having all authors
agree on the workflow <em>before</em> writing starts. Make sure to also
agree on a single method to provide feedback, be it an email thread or
mailing list, an issue tracker, or some sort of shared online to-do
list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We suggest having a meeting (or online thread) of all authors at the
beginning of the writing process. Ask everyone how they would prefer to
write a manuscript. Then agree on a decision and process, and put the
outcome in writing. If co-authors are learning new tools, ask someone
familiar with those tools to support them!</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A common practice in academic writing is for the lead author to email
successive versions of a manuscript to coauthors to collect feedback,
which is returned as changes to the document, comments on the document,
plain text in email, or a mix of all three. This allows co-authors to
use familiar tools, but results in a lot of files to keep track of, and
a lot of tedious manual labor to merge comments to create the next
master version.</p>
<p>However, if a (senior) co-author insists on using a particular
format, like word or LaTeX, or on sending comments by email or written
on printouts, in our experience it can be very difficult to convince
them to change. Two principles make an email-based workflow work:
informative filenames with date and initials, and a single lead author
who co-ordinates.</p>
<blockquote>

and initials of last edit, for example
<code>best_practices_manuscript_2013-12-01_GW.doc</code> would be the

<li>Choose one person to co-ordinate (i.e. the lead author), who is
responsible for merging comments and sending out updated manuscripts to
all other co-authors.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Instead of an email-based workflow, we recommend mirroring good
practices for managing software and data to make writing scalable,
collaborative, and reproducible. As with our recommendations for version
control in general, we suggest that groups choose one of two different
approaches for managing manuscripts. The goals of both are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure that text is accessible to yourself and others now and in
the future by making a single master document that is available to all
coauthors at all times.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the chances of work being lost or people overwriting each
other’s work.</p></li>
<li><p>Make it easy to track and combine contributions from multiple
collaborators.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid duplication and manual entry of information, particularly
in constructing bibliographies, tables of contents, and lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Make it easy to regenerate the final published form (e.g., a PDF)
and to tell if it is up to date.</p></li>
<li><p>Make it easy to share that final version with collaborators and
to submit it to a journal.</p></li>

<p>Our first alternative will already be familiar to many
researchers:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong><em>Write manuscripts using online tools with rich
formatting, change tracking, and reference management</em></strong>,
such as Google Docs or MS OneDrive. With the document online, everyone’s
changes are in one place, and hence don’t need to be merged
manually.</li>
</ol>
<p>We realize that in many cases, even this solution is asking too much
from collaborators who see no reason to move forward from desktop GUI
tools. To satisfy them, the manuscript can be converted to a desktop
editor file format (e.g., Microsoft Word <code>.docx</code> or
LibreOffice <code>.odt</code>) after major changes, then downloaded and
saved in the <code>doc</code> folder. Unfortunately, this means merging
some changes and suggestions manually, as existing tools cannot always
do this automatically when switching from a desktop file format to text
and back (although <a href="https://pandoc.org/" class="external-link">Pandoc</a> can go a
long way).</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The second approach treats papers exactly like software, and has been
used by researchers in mathematics, astronomy, physics, and related
disciplines for decades:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong><em>Write the manuscript in a plain text format that permits
version control</em></strong> such as <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" class="external-link">LaTeX</a> or <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" class="external-link">Markdown</a>, and
then convert them to other formats such as PDF as needed using
scriptable tools like <a href="https://pandoc.org/" class="external-link">Pandoc</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using a version control system provides good support for finding and
merging differences resulting from concurrent changes. It also provides
a convenient platform for making comments and performing review.</p>
<p>This approach re-uses the version control tools and skills used to
manage data and software, and is a good starting point for
fully-reproducible research. However, it requires all contributors to
understand a much larger set of tools, including <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org" class="external-link">markdown</a> or LaTeX, make,
BiBTeX, and Git/GitHub.</p>
<p>It is even possible using this approach to combine manuscripts and

<p>While we feel that text-based version control is a superior method,
the barriers to entry may be too high for many users. The single master
online approach is a good compromise. If your institution has invested
in an environment (Google Docs / MS Office), users can stay within their
familiar desktop GUI applications while still taking advantage of
automatic file versioning and shared editing.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Supplementary materials often contain much of the work that went into
the project, such as tables and figures or more elaborate descriptions
of the algorithms, software, methods, and analyses. In order to make
these materials as accessible to others as possible, do not rely solely
on the PDF format, since extracting data from PDFs is notoriously hard.
For the same reason, Excel is not a suitable file format for table data
that others may want to re-analyze. It is acceptable for summary
statistics tables so long as the underlying data is also available in a
text file format such as CSV.</p>
<p>We recommend separating the results that you may expect others to
reuse (e.g., data in tables, data behind figures) into separate,
text-format files in formats such as CSV, JSON, YAML, XML, or HDF5. The
same holds for any commands or code you want to include as supplementary
material: use the format that most easily enables reuse (source code
files, Unix shell scripts etc).</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We have outlined a series of good enough practices for scientific
computing. These practices are pragmatic, broadly accessible, and can be
applied by both individuals and groups. Most importantly, these
practices make researchers more productive individually by enabling them
to get more done in less time and with less pain. They also accelerate
research as a whole by making work more reproducible.</p>
<p>We have covered good practices in several areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data management</li>
<li>Software</li>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Project organization</li>
<li>Keeping track of changes</li>
<li>Manuscripts</li>
</ul>
<p>We have explained the shared set of principles behind good
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Modular organization</li>
<li>Names</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Collectively, these practices make your work easier to use for other
people, including for your future self. Thinking through your work from
a collaborator’s point of view is helpful, and ultimately kinder to your
future self.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Learning good practices is a long-term process that never stops. We
<a href="what-we-left-out.html">left out many good practices</a> that,
although useful, have more niche applications.</p>
<p>We recommend the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745" class="external-link">Best Practices in
Scientific Computing</a>, especially for those gaining more experience
with coding. There are <a href="resources.html">many other useful papers
and resources that we have selected</a>.</p>
<p>One of your best resources is your colleagues - talk to them! In our
experience, people who have learned good practices themselves are eager
to teach them to others.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Progress in computational good practices comes from different places
in the scientific community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funders can require <a href="https://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans" class="external-link">data
management plans</a> and provide support for data management.</li>
<li>Institutions can value the time that goes into data sharing and
training.</li>
<li>Research librarians, research software engineers, and data managers
support others in learning and applying good practices.</li>
<li>PIs and lab heads can require that lab members share code and data,
and make it easy for them to do so.</li>
<li>Lab members can organise “data curation days” and training sessions
to share good practices.</li>
<li>Self-organised groups led by students and postdocs can share ideas
and train each other.</li>
<li>Global organisations like <a href="https://carpentries.org" class="external-link">The
Carpentries</a> can co-ordinate training and support training
materials.</li>
<li>Professional societies can help to organise training.</li>
</ul>
<p>It takes time to learn good practices, and time to train others. This
time has to be valued by individuals, funders, institutions, and the
scientific community.</p>
<p>Developing your own good practices is ultimately a personal journey
that will impact your career and impact the people around you. Maybe
today you will learn to write README files, or next year you might start
using version control, or in the future you could find yourself teaching
students to write data management plans for their projects.</p>
