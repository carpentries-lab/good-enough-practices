### Challenges in data-heavy biology

- All your raw data are digital files
    - How do you manage them?
- There are many tools to process data
    - Too much choice, many bad choices
    - e.g. Excel changes gene names, and loses COVID test results...
- There are more steps to understand
    - Where do you even start?

### Good news! Your problems are not unique

- Other people have thought about good practices and created good tools
- You don’t have to reinvent them
- You can learn them
- BUT this is an ongoing process through your career
