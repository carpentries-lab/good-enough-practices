## Learning good practices is a long-term process

We have outlined a series of good enough practices for scientific computing.
These practices are pragmatic, broadly accessible, and can be applied by both individuals and groups. 
Most importantly, these practices make researchers more productive individually by enabling them to get more done in less time and with less pain.  
They also accelerate research as a whole by making work more reproducible.

We have covered good practices in several areas:

- Data management
- Software
- Collaboration
- Project organization
- Keeping track of changes
- Manuscripts

Good Enough Practices rely on a shared set of principles that span these areas:

- Planning: plan out how to work, and any plan that you can stick to is better than no plan.
- Modular organisation: organise your data, code, and projects into coherent modules.
- Names: give good names to your files, folders, and functions, that make them easy to find and to understand.
- Documentation: explicitly write down everything you and your collaborators need to know in the future.

Collectively, this makes your work easier to use for other people, including for your future self. 
Thinking through your work from a collaborator's point of view is helpful, and ultimately kinder to your future self.

## What we left out, and where to learn more

Learning good practices is a long-term process that never stops.
We [left out many good practices](_extras/what-we-left-out.md) that, although useful,
have more niche application.
We recommend the paper [Best Practices in Scientific Computing](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745),
especially for those gaining more experience with coding.
There are [many other useful papers and resources that we have selected](_extras/resources.md)

One of your best resources is your colleagues - talk to them!
In our experience, people who have learned good practices themselves are eager to teach them to others.

## Different people make different contributions to good practice

For the scientific community as a whole, progress in computational good
practices will not happen by itself. The practices are being
increasingly incentivized through requirements from funding agencies and
journals, but the time and skills required to put these approaches into
practice are still not being valued.

At a local level, PIs can have the most impact, requiring that the
research their lab produces follow these recommendations. Even if a PI
doesn't have a background in computation, they can require that students
show and share their code in lab meetings and with lab mates, that data
is available and accessible to all in the lab and that computational
methods sections are comprehensive. PIs can also value the time it takes
to do these things effectively and provide opportunities for training.

Universities can also support such efforts. While this is often provided
by IT or High Performance Computing (HPC) groups, research librarians
are an often under-appreciated resource. Librarians have thought about
and worked with data and provenance even before these computational
challenges and increasingly have dedicated data librarians on staff who
have an explicit service role.

Many campuses also have self-organized groups led by students who wish
to learn from each other, which may operate independently or in concert
with organizations like Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or
The Hacker Within[^38].

Finally, many funding agencies now require data management plans and
education and outreach activities. The true cost of implementing these
plans includes training: it is unfair as well as counter-productive to
insist that researchers do things without teaching them how. We believe
it is now time for funders to invest in such training; we hope that our
recommendations will help shape consensus on what "good enough" looks
like and how to achieve it.
