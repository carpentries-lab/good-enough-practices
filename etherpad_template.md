## Introduction

### Discussion: research computing rights and wrongs

What can go wrong in research computing?

- - - 
What can go right in research computing?

- - - 
## Data management

### Discussion: Data management problems

- - - 
### Exercise: Backing up your data

*Tag with G for good and B for bad:*

- Commercial cloud service
- In-house cloud service
- USB pen-drive
- External hard-drive
- My laptop
- My workstation's hard-disk
- Network drive

### Discussion: which file formats do you store data in?

- - - 
### Discussion with partner: analysis friendly data

*Vote with + for which table format you and your partner think is more friendly*

- column names: site, 1999, 2000
- column names: site, year, cases

### Discussion with group: sharing with the world

What type of data is each of these a good place for sharing?

- Group 1: Personal/lab web-site
- Group 2: Github
- Group 3: General repo (i.e.: Zenodo, Data Dryad, etc.)
- Group 4: Community specific repo (i.e.: ArrayExpress, SRA, EGA, PRIDE, etc.)

## Software

### Discussion: what can go wrong with research software?

- - - 
### Exercise: which of these are good code comments?

*Discuss with your neighbour and vote with + beside ones you think are good.*

- "this function reads a file"
- file name
- file type
- output type
- date
- function author
- function version
- data columns or other properties
- expected file path / address (for example a specific directory or web address)
- all of the above

## Collaboration

### Discussion in groups

- Group 1: How does collaboration help in scientific computing?
- Group 2: What goes wrong with collaboration?
- Group 3: How can you prepare to collaborate?

### Discussion: what information belongs in a project README?

- - - 
## Project organization

### Discussion in groups: what goes wrong?

- - - 
### Exercise: file organization by directory

```
COSMIC_V94_download.csv
ensembl_variant_calls.pl
hg38.fa
multiplot.R
mutation_counts_by_primary_site.csv
mutation_counts.txt
p2_1_1.fastq.gz
p2_1_2.fastq.gz
p2_1.align.log
p2_1.bam
p2_1.bam.bai
p7_1_1.fastq.gz
p7_1_2.fastq.gz
p7_1.align.log
p7_1.bam
p7_1.bam.bai
parse_gdc_files_json.py
population_freq_by_codon_and_position.png
README.md
read_metrics.csv
read_processing.txt
read_quality_control_report.html
sample_counts_by_primary_site.csv
sample_ids.txt
```

### Exercise: file sorting

- What are the problems with having the date first?
- How do different date formats behave once sorted?
- Can you tell the importance of a leading 0 (zeros)?
- Is it equally easy to find all data from LD conditions as ON media?
- Can you spot the problem when using different cases (upper/lower)?
- Do you see benefits of keeping consistent lengths of the naming conventions?
- Do you see what happens when you mix conventions?

## Keeping track of changes

### Exercise: has this ever happened to you?

*Vote with + beside each item*

- I have fifteen versions of this file and I don't know which is which
- I can't remake this figure from last year
- I modified my code and something apparently unrelated does not work anymore
- I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something
- Somebody duplicated a record in a shared file with samples
- You remember seeing a data file but cannot find it anymore : is it deleted ? Moved away ?
- I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data
- I have to merge changes to a paper from mails with collaborators
- I accidently deleted a part of my work
- I came to an old project and forgot where I left it
- I have trouble to find the source of a mistake in an experiment
- My directory is polluted with a lot of unused/temporary/old folders because I'm afraid of losing something important
- I made a lot of changes to my paper but only want to bring back one of paragraph

### Discussion: What are your tips and strategies for keeping track of changes in your work?

- - - - - 
### Discussion: what should be documented when you change something?
