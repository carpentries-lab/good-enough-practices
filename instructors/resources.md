This page has a collection of resources on good practices in scientific computing.
Feel free to refer to them.

## Some other lessons with different emphasis

The FAIR principles describe work that is **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable.

These lessons are in a similar format and discuss good practices within the FAIR principles:

- [FAIR in Biological practice, a 2-day comprehensive introduction](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-bio-practice)
- [FAIR for Leaders, 1-day lesson aimed at established PIs and institutional leaders who set policy and drive changes](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-for-leaders/). Note, this lesson is under construction as of December 2022

## Ten simple rules for reproducible computational research

- Keep Track of How Every Result Was Produced
- Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps
- Track Versions of All External Programs Used
- Version Control Your Protocols/Scripts
- Record All Intermediate Results
- Track Relevant Sources of Randomness
- Store Raw Data behind Plots
- Allow Layers of Detail to Be Inspected
- Connect Statements to Underlying Results
- Share Scripts, Runs, and Results

## Research is changing

For example,"papers" aren't paper any more

- Executable research articles in eLife: [https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press/eb096af1/elife-launches-executable-research-articles-for-publishing-computationally-reproducible-results](https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press/eb096af1/elife-launches-executable-research-articles-for-publishing-computationally-reproducible-results)
- Interactive figures in f1000 articles: [https://blog.f1000.com/2017/07/19/so-long-static-we-now-support-interactive-ploty-figures-in-our-articles/](https://blog.f1000.com/2017/07/19/so-long-static-we-now-support-interactive-ploty-figures-in-our-articles/)
- Preprints: arxiv, biorxiv,...

## Resources: External Training

Many institutions and societies run training courses, for example:

- [The Carpentries teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide](https://carpentries.org/)
- [ELIXIR training platform for bioinformatics](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/training)
- [EMBL](https://www.embl.de/training/events/index.php)
- [Cold Spring Harbor](https://meetings.cshl.edu/courseshome.aspx)
- [Woods Hole](https://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/)

For more courses:

- look at the posters on the walls around your lab
- ask for advice!
- talk to the head of your PhD program, postdoctoral fellows office, etc.
- google "bioinformatics course", etc.
