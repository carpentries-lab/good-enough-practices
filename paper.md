# Summary

We present a half-day learning module targeted at a broad audience of researchers who want to learn how to be more efficient and effective in their data analysis and computing, whatever their career stage. 
These practices encompass data management, software and programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, keeping track of changes, and writing manuscripts.
Good Enough Practices rely on a shared set of principles that span these areas: planning, modular organization, names, and documentation.
Planning out how to work is essential, and any plan that you and your collaboratrs can stick to is better than no plan.
Organizing your data, code, and projects into coherent modules makes them easier to understand and to re-use.
Giving good names to your files, folders, and functions, makes them easy to find and to understand.
Explicitly documenting everything that you and your collaborators need to know in the future communicates your plans and organization.
Good Enough Practices has been delivered to and evaluated by PhD and post-doctoral researchers over several years.
The lesson is in The Carpentries format and the materials are open-source and hosted on github.


# Statement of Need

> explain how the submitted artifacts contribute to computationally enabled teaching and learning, and describing how they might be adopted by others.

# Learning objectives, design, and experience

> describe the learning objectives, content, instructional design, and experience of use in teaching and learning situations.

# How the lesson came to be

The lesson is inspired by and based on the paper, Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing (Wilson et al., 2017): "a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill".
